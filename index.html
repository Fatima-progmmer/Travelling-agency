                    It is difficult for visitors to catch buses and trains as public transport networks are set up
                    mainly for the local
                    commuter. In cities, tourists are therefore advised to travel by taxi, even though they are more
                    expensive. Clients
                    should always ask the hotel to book a tad for them as hotels have reliable and safe ted companies
                    that they use
                    regularly.
